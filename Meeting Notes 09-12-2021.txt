* Agreeing on the bus timings (Harsh)
* Fixing the constants for initial simulation (Will)
	- running_consumption 
	- service_consumption
	- level_mean
	- n_buses 

SIMULATION
Major thing - Convergence study for delays 

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
* Fixing the ranges for constants for sensitivity analysis (Anirudh)
	- running_consumption 
	- service_consumption
	- level_mean
	- n_buses 

* Distribute among 

VARIANCE REDUCTION
* Comaprision of alternatives

RESULTS
* Delays
* Costs (Krishna)
	- Consumption of fuel
	- Service times and travel times
	- Initial investments on the buses - n_buses
	- Cost associated to delay
	- Number of refuel stations - 2

	* Cost associated to delays - done
	* Costs of refill
	* Costs of running buses - done
	* Costs of service - done
	* Costs of refuel - done
	* Number of employees and buses
	
	* Fixed costs should be separate
	* Running costs should be on a per day average based on number of replications
